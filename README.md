# CS-360-Final
My final project for CS 360
**Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?**
This application was designed to allow a user to track their weight loss over a period of time and then notify them once they had met their goal weight

**What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?**
A login screen was important as their could potentially be many users with different information, anda  database screen where the users daily weight was stored in a graph, notifying them once their daily wieght and their goal weight were equal.

**How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?**
Mainly using SQL and CRUD I developed a procedure for updating a user daily weight, once that was done it checked it against the goal weight and then it would have sent off and SMS had I completed the application. The rest of the CRUD was used to add or edit table data.
**How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?**
As I didn't finish my project then code is not currently functional, however I would have compiled and ran the code myself creating an account within my own database and testing it from there, most likely submitting it to the app store for final inspections.
**Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?**
As coding has never been a strong suit of mine as my memory is not the best, designing and developing a complex system that I can make as simple as possible is my ideal goal that way I don't have difficulty interacting with my own system and neither does my user. If I can stop problems before I get to the code stage basic problem solving becomes much easier.
**In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?**
As I didn't finish the application it's hard to say however if I had to give myself a compliment I would say ensuring that each screen adheres to standard UI/UX deesign and the design is a simple and constant as possible will enable my users to easily navigate my screens allowing for ease of user access.
